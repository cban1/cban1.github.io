    <p>This is a sample of portal.</p>
    <p>This is how you start a new paragraph. This makes almost no sense 
    whatsoever, but it is HTML, so it is almost required to know for 
    a webpage to work!</p>
    
    <p>This site is a basic (really basic, really) way to share all the 
    information that I could possibly want to share. In my personal opinion, I 
    think that HTML is best suited to active documents. Many things tend to 
    work well with HTML. All you need is a basic web browser and some files 
    that you can open to see thier contents within. </p>
